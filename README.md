# How I worked on this project

My goal was to get used to working with the React Ecosystem and Typescript.

- I set up multiple routes using react-router 
- I handled styling using styled-components 
- I implemented a feature based project folder structure, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable project

# Why I built this project this way

- Typescript is more relevant by the day, even though this is a simple project there isn't a downside to it aside from taking slightly longer to write. 
- styled-components is one of the most used styling libraries, it uses the CSS-IN-JS approach, which I was not familiar with before this project.
- react-router enables client side routing, which provides a better user experience as the views are rendered instantly.
